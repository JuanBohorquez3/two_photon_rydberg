    Computes rabi frequency between two states zeeman states given electric field strength and
    the reduced dipole moment between them.

    Our two states can be described as |a,j,m> and |ap,jp,mp> where p represents primed states,
    and a/ap correspond to unaccounted for quantum numbers between the states.

    The returned value is given by the Wignerâ€“Eckart theorem.

    rabi_frequency =

    where:
        hb = reduced planck constant, as provided in constants.py
        c_a = weight of polarization that is allowed for dipole coupling between m and mp
        q_a = polarization that is allowed for dipole coupling between m and mp

    Args:
        electric_field : electric field amplitude of field coupling two states (V/m)
        q : length three list describing the relative polarization of the light in the spherical
            basis [e_+1, e_0, e_-1]
        d : reduced dipole matrix element between the states (m)
        j : angular momentum quantum number for initial state
        m : zeeman state quantum number for initial state
        jp : angular momentum quantum number for other state
        mp : zeeman state quantum number for other state
