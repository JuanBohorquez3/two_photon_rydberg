# two_photon_rydberg
A collection of computations and calculations for understanding two photon rydberg excitations

This code base will be organized into two parts:
1. Code used to make computations based on analytical solutions to the relevant system, making certain simplifying assumption (eg RWA, adiabatic elimination)
1. Code used to numerically compute the dynamics of the system with minimal approximations.

## 1. Analytical solutions
Here it is important to keep track of which approximations we make, and what factors we consider small within those approximations. I indend to maintain tex documents detailing these computations, as well as in-line tex within jupyter notebooks used to test and demonstrate these computations.

## 2. Numerical computations
This is a more difficult aspect but I intend to get a start soon
